<p>Egg whites are great for building muscle and lowering cholesterol, but it turns out that they have benefits far beyond the kitchen.</p>



<p>Researchers at Princeton Engineering last year found a way to turn your breakfast food into a new material that can cheaply remove microplastics from our oceans.</p>



<p>Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that result from both commercial product development and the breakdown of larger plastics. They can find their way into our food and water, causing a variety of health problems. They’re also everywhere — it’s estimated that there are more than 24 trillion pieces in our oceans.</p>



<p>Using regular, store-bought egg whites, the team at Princeton created an aerogel, which is a lightweight material that can be used for water filtration, energy storage, and thermal insulation. The idea for this process came during lunch, as Craig Arnold, the vice dean of innovation at Princeton, was eating a sandwich.</p>



<p>“I was sitting there, staring at the bread in my sandwich. And I thought to myself, ‘This is exactly the kind of structure that we need,’” Arnold told Phys.org.</p>



<p>Arnold set his team to work, asking them to replicate the aerogel structure he had in mind by mixing carbon with a variety of bread recipes. The group continued to take away ingredients throughout its tests until the egg whites were the only thing left.</p>



<p>“We started with a more complex system, and we just kept reducing, reducing, reducing, until we got down to the core of what it was,” Arnold told Phys.org. “It was the proteins in the egg whites that were leading to the structures that we needed.”</p>



<p>Egg whites are more complicated than they may seem and can be transformed into interconnected strands of carbon fibers and sheets of graphene, an ultra-thin compound that can ultimately be turned into graphite.</p>



<p>To accomplish this transformation, the researchers freeze-dried the proteins in egg whites, then heated them to 900 degrees Celsius (above 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit) in an environment without oxygen.</p>



<p>In a paper published in Materials Today, Arnold and his co-authors showed that the resulting material can remove both salt and microplastics from seawater — with 98% and 99% efficiency, respectively.</p>



<p>The resulting egg white material is inexpensive to produce, energy efficient, and highly effective. As Sehmus Ozden, one of the paper’s authors, stated: “Activated carbon is one of the cheapest materials used for water purification. We compared our results with activated carbon, and it’s much better.”</p>

<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about England&#8217;s rollercoaster ride at the ICC events. Hold onto your seats, because it&#8217;s been a real nail-biter.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Big ICC Upsets: England&#8217;s Unpredictable Journey</h3>



<p>England, the land of cricket, has seen its fair share of ups and downs on the cricket pitch. In this World Cup, they&#8217;ve been caught in another whirlwind as they faced the astonishing might of Afghanistan in the heart of Delhi. England&#8217;s journey in the ICC events reads like a suspense novel. The plot twists and turns, leaving fans in sheer disbelief. From underdogs to upset masters, here are a few iconic moments that left everyone scratching their heads.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Afghanistan Stunner</h4>



<p>So, you probably saw the recent headline: &#8220;England Stunned by Afghanistan in Delhi.&#8221; It&#8217;s no secret that Afghanistan has some serious cricket talent, but taking down the mighty English squad? That&#8217;s the kind of shocker we all love to see.</p>



<p>Afghanistan’s only previous 50-over World Cup victory had come against Scotland in 2015. Eight years later in Delhi, they toppled the reigning world champions and in a stunningly comprehensive display. After being asked to bat first, Rahmanullah Gurbaz’s 80 from 57 powered Afghanistan to 114 for 0 in the 17th over, and though England’s spinners limited the target to 285, their Afghan counterparts throttled the life out of the chase. Mujeeb, Rashid and Nabi shared eight wickets between them as victory was sealed by 69 runs and with 9.3 overs unused.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ireland&#8217;s Underdog Triumph</h4>



<p>Another one for the history books was Ireland&#8217;s stunning victory over England. The Irish lads showed that no matter how big the opposition, determination and teamwork could trump even the most formidable adversaries.</p>



<p>One of the most memorable matches in recent World Cup history saw Kevin O&#8217;Brien score an incredible 113 off 63 balls, breaking the record for the fastest World Cup century along the way, to get Ireland past England&#8217;s 327. England had been coasting, with a big score on the board and Ireland reduced to 111 for 5. But then O&#8217;Brien and the lower middle-order played with freedom, and England&#8217;s bowlers succumbed to the pressure.</p>



<p><strong>Netherland&#8217;s Out of the Box Group Stage Battle</strong></p>



<p>In the 2009 World T20, there was a preliminary group phase, aimed at weeding out the weaker teams. England almost derailed those plans by losing to Netherlands, who had got in through the qualifying tournament. Netherlands chased down 163 as Stuart Broad and Adil Rashid went for big runs. England saved face by beating Pakistan in their next game and making it to the next round.</p>



<p>Cricket, folks, is a game that&#8217;s as unpredictable as a jack-in-the-box. One day, you&#8217;re riding high, feeling like the king of the world. The next, you&#8217;re left scratching your head, wondering if you&#8217;ve stumbled into a parallel universe. And, let me tell you, England, with all its glory and cricketing talent, has taken us on a wild rollercoaster of emotions.</p>



<p>Now, the big million-dollar question, y&#8217;all: out of all these jaw-dropping upsets, which one really knocked our socks off? Well, I gotta say, it&#8217;s a real head-scratcher because each of these games brought its own unique flavor of shock and awe.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about a battle of giants, like David vs. Goliath, when England squared off against Afghanistan in Delhi. The Brits, loaded with cricketing superstars, were supposed to walk all over the Afghan side. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans, right? Sports, my friends, they&#8217;ll throw you a curveball when you least expect it.</p>



<p>And then, there was that sneaky move by the Proteas when England faced South Africa. We thought it would be a walk in the park for the Brits, a piece of cake. But no siree, the Proteas had other tricks up their sleeves. They played their game like a finely tuned piano, leaving England scratching their heads and thinking, &#8220;What on earth just happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! Ireland&#8217;s Cinderella story. Now, this is the stuff fairy tales are made of, folks. A true underdog story that warmed the cockles of our hearts and brought a tear to the eye. It was a reminder that in this beautiful game of cricket, anyone, I mean anyone, can step up and become a hero, no matter their ranking or reputation.</p>



<p>So there you have it, all you cricket fanatics out there. England&#8217;s journey in ICC events has been a wild ride, full of hairpin turns and loop-de-loops. With each unexpected twist and turn, it&#8217;s like trying to catch a firefly in a jar. It&#8217;s hard to put your finger on which shocker really had us on the edge of our seats. But one thing&#8217;s for sure, folks &#8211; when it comes to cricket, you better be ready for the unexpected.</p>



<p>So, stay tuned for more heart-pounding updates from the world of sports, right here with your buddy, Anderson Cooper. Until next time, keep your peepers glued to the pitch because in cricket, my friends, you never know what&#8217;s gonna come hurtling your way!</p>

			<title>Apple&#8217;s Game-Changer: The iOS 17 &#8220;Screen Distance&#8221; Feature That&#8217;s Saving Your Eyes.</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://mga.missouri.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Distance.webp" class="type:primaryImage" /></figure>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a little confession to make &#8211; I&#8217;ve been living with a not-so-secret affliction known as near-sightedness (myopia) for as long as I can remember. But hey, it&#8217;s not just me; the whole world seems to be in the same boat. Myopia cases have almost doubled in the US since 1971, and a whopping 90% of folks in Asia are grappling with it. It&#8217;s a myopia epidemic, folks.</p>



<p>So, you can imagine my excitement when Apple dropped a bombshell last month – a brand-new feature for iPhones that could potentially be a game-changer. They call it the &#8220;screen distance&#8221; feature, and it&#8217;s all about promoting healthier screen habits, reducing eye strain, and helping us ditch those pesky nearsightedness issues.</p>



<p>Now, you&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;I bet you need the latest and greatest iPhone 15 for this.&#8221; But the good news is, you don&#8217;t! All you need is to update your iPhone to the latest software, iOS 17, and have a trusty iPhone with a TrueDepth camera (yes, the same one that makes Face ID magic happen). So, let&#8217;s get into the nitty-gritty of how to activate this game-changing feature:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Turn on the &#8220;Screen Distance&#8221; Feature</h2>



<ol>
<li>Open up your phone&#8217;s settings.</li>



<li>Head over to &#8220;Screen Time.&#8221;</li>



<li>Look for &#8220;Screen Distance&#8221; and give it a friendly tap to turn it on.</li>
</ol>



<p>Simple, right? But you might wonder, why all this fuss about myopia and screen distance? Well, science backs it up. Experts believe that the surge in nearsightedness rates is closely linked to our screens. Spending too much time glued to your device, combined with a lack of outdoor adventures in the sunlight, is a recipe for myopia. The Mayo Clinic even chimes in, saying that excessive screen time and hours spent squinting at your screen up close significantly boost your myopia risk. The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that screens should be about 25 inches away, or roughly an arm&#8217;s length from your precious peepers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I Got the &#8220;Too Close&#8221; Memo Real Quick</h2>



<p>So, of course, I couldn&#8217;t resist being the guinea pig. I cranked up the feature and decided to hold my phone way too close to my face while scrolling through my Instagram feed. I mean, who doesn&#8217;t love a good experiment, right?</p>



<p>In about 3-4 minutes, a message popped up on my screen, politely informing me, &#8220;iPhone may be too close.&#8221; A gentle nudge, I&#8217;d say. I listened and moved my phone back to arm&#8217;s length, and voila – a checkmark appeared, and the message changed to &#8220;your iPhone is now at a recommended screen distance.&#8221; I also got a handy &#8220;continue&#8221; button to get back to my scrolling business.</p>



<p>Now, here&#8217;s where it gets interesting. I thought I&#8217;d go back to my regular phone-holding habits, like we all do. But guess what? The screen popped up again. And again. And again. It turns out I&#8217;ve been consistently holding my phone too close. Guilty as charged!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Not-So-Nagging Reminder</h2>



<p>After using this feature for a couple of weeks, I realized something remarkable. I don&#8217;t get those notifications as often as I did initially. It&#8217;s like a gentle reminder, like a friend tapping your shoulder when you&#8217;re about to do something you shouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve become more mindful about keeping my phone at arm&#8217;s length, and those little screen-distance notifications have made me more aware of my screen habits.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it; most of us spend at least eight hours a day glued to our laptops. In between work, we sneak in moments of screen time on our phones, sometimes while watching TV. Having a little digital angel on your shoulder reminding you to take a break from those screens is rather helpful.</p>



<p>But, here&#8217;s the kicker: chatting with my eye doctor, my trusted guide of over a decade, unveiled something even more crucial. While Apple&#8217;s iOS 17 feature is a step in the right direction and can help reduce eye strain, it&#8217;s not the ultimate cure for the myopia epidemic. Dr. Nicholas Despotidis, an expert in the field, believes it&#8217;s essential to address the bigger picture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Beyond the Screen Distance</h2>



<p>Dr. Despotidis, a fellow in the American Academy of Optometry and American Academy of Orthokeratology and Myopia Control, is deeply concerned about the rising myopia cases among children. And he&#8217;s got a point. It&#8217;s not just about holding your phone at arm&#8217;s length; it&#8217;s about what you do when you&#8217;re not staring at the screen.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think this is better than nothing, but I do feel that it might be simplifying a much broader problem,&#8221; says Dr. Despotidis. He emphasizes the importance of limiting screen time, especially for kids, and ensuring that they spend quality time outdoors in natural light. Scientific research has shown that natural light significantly reduces the risk of developing myopia.</p>



<p>In Dr. Despotidis&#8217;s words, &#8220;The bottom line is that if you&#8217;re staring at your screen for hours, it&#8217;ll give you eye strain whether you&#8217;re holding it two inches or 18 inches away from your face. I worry it might give parents or consumers a false sense of security.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, while the &#8220;screen distance&#8221; feature is a fantastic addition to our digital lives, it&#8217;s essential to remember that it&#8217;s just one piece of the puzzle. Keeping our screens at the right distance is a good start, but let&#8217;s not forget the importance of outdoor adventures and soaking up some natural sunlight.</p>



<p>In the end, myopia might be a complex issue, but it&#8217;s one we can tackle, one step at a time. So, keep that screen at arm&#8217;s length, but also make sure you&#8217;re not missing out on the beautiful world beyond it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://mga.missouri.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Duck-Duck-Go.webp" class="type:primaryImage" /></figure>
<p>In a recent development that has sent shockwaves through the tech world, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple </a>is rumored to be in talks with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DuckDuckGo</a>, exploring the possibility of replacing <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google </a>as the primary search engine for Safari&#8217;s incognito mode. This intriguing revelation comes straight from Bloomberg News and is backed by sources deeply embedded in the situation.</p>



<p>While the exact details of these negotiations are shrouded in secrecy, the anticipation is building, and it&#8217;s expected that we&#8217;ll soon have a clearer picture later this week. This disclosure follows a significant courtroom event where Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google, ordered the revelation of testimonies from DuckDuckGo&#8217;s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, and Apple&#8217;s executive, John Giannandrea.</p>



<p>The report promises not only to unveil the intricacies of Apple&#8217;s discussions with DuckDuckGo but also to shed light on conversations involving Microsoft and Apple. Judge Mehta&#8217;s ruling has given us a glimpse into the complex web of transactions within the tech industry.</p>



<p>In response to these reports, Apple, DuckDuckGo, and Google have maintained a conspicuous silence. Their hushed responses have given rise to speculation about how this potential shift could reshape the competitive landscape in the world of web exploration.</p>



<p>These developments unfold against the backdrop of a landmark trial in the United States, where the Department of Justice has accused Google of engaging in unfair practices. The core allegation revolves around Google&#8217;s alleged annual payments of $10 billion to smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, and wireless carriers like AT&amp;T, in exchange for cementing its position as the dominant search engine on their devices.</p>



<p>Satya Nadella, Microsoft&#8217;s CEO, testified during this trial and highlighted the fierce competition among tech giants for invaluable content crucial to training artificial intelligence algorithms. Nadella expressed concerns about Google&#8217;s exclusive deals with publishers, arguing that they were locking essential content behind costly paywalls. Furthermore, Nadella revealed Microsoft&#8217;s attempts to make its Bing search engine the default choice on Apple smartphones but faced significant resistance.</p>



<p>These recent developments hint at a potential transformation in the dynamics of the search engine industry. Apple&#8217;s exploration of alternatives to Google underscores its commitment to enhancing the user experience and expanding its tech affiliations. In the days to come, we can expect more clarity on the future of exploration on Apple&#8217;s Safari browser and the broader implications for the tech ecosystem.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the discussions between Apple and DuckDuckGo mark a significant milestone in the ongoing evolution of the digital landscape, with potential ramifications for both users and major tech players. The world is eagerly awaiting further details to gauge the significance of this potential transition.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://mga.missouri.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphone13-vs-iphone15.webp" class="type:primaryImage" /></figure>
<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/features/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 15</u></a>&nbsp;brings several premium specs to Apple’s entry-level flagship. However, many of those additions, like the Dynamic Island and the slightly brighter screens, are incremental or cosmetic rather than substantial upgrades to the iPhone experience &#8212; even when pitted against a two-year-old&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/iphone-13-review" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 13</u></a>.</p>



<p>Besides, Apple omitted several key features that have been standard in the iPhone 15’s price range such as a higher refresh rate, quicker charging speeds, and the action button, which are now expected to trickle down to its successor next year.</p>



<p>Side by side, there’s not a whole lot setting the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 13 apart. In most scenarios, the differences in the iPhone 15’s improved camera quality and performance are negligible. Some may even prefer the iPhone 13’s solid hues over the iPhone 15’s muted, pastel-esque color options, and the former’s Lightning port so that they don’t have to bin their existing accessories without a dongle.</p>



<p>So should you pick the now-discounted iPhone 13 over an iPhone 15 and save a couple hundred bucks? Or, if you already own one, should you upgrade? Here’s what we found in our in-depth comparison.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: specs</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: design and build</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8oBmoFtATzpxQG1mi1KcvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/6a545d64c0766e40151adff9c3fc56c1" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>The iPhone 15 inherits the same design Apple debuted way back on the iPhone 12: glass on the front and back held in place with an aluminum frame and a protruding housing on the rear’s top left corner for the camera system. But there are a couple of notable tweaks that make the iPhone 15 more comfortable to hold.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d541GyRPa_KfFbxShPIhZQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/a4a2893f914fd996e7d306966ec3f3d5" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>The edges, for starters, are a tad contoured as opposed to the iPhone 13’s sharp squared-off ones that can feel like they’re biting into your palm over prolonged use. More importantly, the iPhone 15 features a new, “color-infused” glass on the back, which has a smooth matte finish. Instead of a solid color, Apple has chosen to infuse it throughout the back of the iPhone 15. The result is a set of faint shades you may or may not like. In fact, on variants like blue, you can barely notice the color now and it looks nearly white.</p>



<p>Whether that’s a win or not depends on your preferences. Personally, I’m a fan. It’s a unique approach and, especially given that the camera module has a darker tint, it contrasts well with the rest of the lighter gradient.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wVCz7R5vjgUbI0hw1h0ahg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/ef2988cf3d4515099955db57b49d7a8f" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>While the iPhone 15’s polished texture feels nice, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it doesn’t attract nearly the amount of smudges that tend to stick to the iPhone 13’s glossy rear. On the other, the absence of that tactility makes the iPhone 15 far more slippery and undoes the edge’s improved ergonomics. Another downside of the iPhone 15’s design is that its camera bump protrudes further out and therefore, it wobbles a little more than the iPhone 13 when placed down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7GvsMEUiKPDWA8NL2E1ctg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/110f183b68413321644aff6253fb5fdd" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>While the screen is off, you’d be hard-pressed to tell apart the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 13 from the front. Switch it on, however, and you’ll notice they sport different notch styles. The iPhone 15 offers what Apple calls a “<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/features/iphone-14-pro-finally-embraces-the-notch-welcome-to-dynamic-island" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Dynamic Island</u></a>,” an interactive pill-shaped cutout that not only does a better job of concealing the Face ID sensors underneath it, but also elongates into the larger, main screen to project live activities like how far out your cab is, or the remaining times on &nbsp;your stopwatch. You can even touch it to expand it and access controls such as the option to shut down the timer or pause your music.</p>



<p>In its idle state, Dynamic Island also consumes less space than the iPhone 13’s traditional notch but it is placed lower, meaning the status bar is taller. If an app hasn’t been optimized to support the Dynamic Island, that means losing more screen real estate than the notch. The good news is, since it was released last year on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/apple-iphone-14-pro" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 14 Pro</u></a>&nbsp;series, there are barely any apps that don’t support it.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Draw</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: display</h2>



<p>Both phones have an identical Super Retina OLED screen and a full-HD resolution. They are sharp, vibrant, and support HDR as well as Apple’s True Tone tech – which automatically adapts the display’s temperature to your room’s ambience. However, in the iPhone 15’s case, you have two screen sizes to choose from: 6.1 and 6.7 inches, whereas the iPhone 13 is limited to 6.1 inches since Apple discontinued the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/iphone-13-mini" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>13 mini</u></a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yD_i94bxWvUsHlxLU62r7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/15f77d856f62b5dd614ca824866db503" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>The iPhone 15’s screen is also more vivid and can achieve a peak outdoor brightness of 2,000 nits &#8212; nearly double that of the iPhone 13. While in day-to-day activities this difference won’t matter, it will come in handy if you spend more time outside. Under direct sunlight, at say, the beach, text on the iPhone 13 is still readable, but you’d have to focus your vision for it. On the iPhone 15, however, the screen can get so bright you’d think you’re indoors.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: iPhone 15</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: ports and connectivity</h2>



<p>One of the most vital quality-of-life upgrades the iPhone 15 offers is it replaces Apple’s proprietary Lightning port with USB-C. It’s a universal connector you’ll also find on several other Apple products like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>MacBook</u></a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/apple-ipad-2021" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>iPad</u></a>, and its arrival on the iPhone finally eliminates the need for you to carry multiple cables. That said, Apple hasn’t enabled higher data transfer speeds on the iPhone 15 (unlike its Pro counterpart) and it supports the same USB 2 standard as the iPhone 13.</p>



<p>While the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/phones/iphone/the-special-thing-about-apples-iphone-15-usb-c-port-is-that-it-isnt-special" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 15’s USB-C port</u></a>&nbsp;is convenient, it can prove to be a hassle if you own numerous Lightning accessories. A $29 adapter can let you continue to use them, but you’ll have to live with the hassle of carrying it around everywhere. The USB-C does have its own perks, however: it’s compatible with far more peripherals like external displays and portable storage devices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.RtoOSp.oQ5am6CFHZJxYA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/94e206d158a8b6eead832fce1744eafa" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>In addition, the iPhone 15 allows you to connect to emergency and road assistance services via satellite when you’re stuck in places without mobile connectivity. Its upgraded sensors can also detect if you’re in a “severe” car crash, and automatically call for help.</p>



<p>The iPhone 15’s hardware upsides don’t end there. Its second-gen ultra wideband chip and improved Bluetooth help you precisely find your Find My accessories and friends at over 3-4 times longer distances than the iPhone 13. This bump-up is noticeable in real life too: I tried to locate a hidden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/apple-airtag" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>AirTag</u></a>&nbsp;inside an office and the iPhone 15 began to offer me precise directions much further out.</p>



<p>The iPhone 13 does hold one advantage. It has a physical SIM tray alongside support for eSIM. In the United States, the iPhone 15 is only compatible with eSIMs.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: iPhone 15</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: performance and battery life</h2>



<p>The iPhone 15 runs on a superior A16 Bionic chip and houses an extra 2GB of RAM (6GB vs 4GB). While both phones’ processors are powered by a 6-core CPU and a 16-core Neutral Engine for on-device intelligence, the A16 has an additional core inside its GPU and it has 50% more memory bandwidth. In Geekbench tests, the iPhone 15 scores were about 10% higher.</p>



<p>As the benchmark results suggest, there’s not much separating the two. Each performs well in day-to-day tasks and I’m yet to face a stutter on either of them – even when I try to multitask between resource-intensive tasks. Despite the GPU benefits, the iPhone 15 isn’t remarkably better at video games except for loading titles like Asphalt 9 a few seconds quicker, and it can’t render AAA games, unlike the 15 Pro.</p>



<p>The iPhone 15’s CPU consumes 20% less power and that shows in its endurance. Though both phones can comfortably last a routine day on a single charge, you can get an hour more screen time out of the new iPhone 15. In real-life use, that can translate into a couple of hours of additional battery life. The iPhone 15 Plus, on the other hand, easily clocks about six hours of screen time, and can go on for a day and a half.</p>



<p>Charging speeds are identical as well. Over wired connections, a 20W adapter can top up the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 13 to 50% in nearly thirty minutes. Both are also compatible with 15W charging over MagSafe and 7.5W on Qi wireless chargers.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: iPhone 15</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: cameras</h2>



<p>The area where you can really get your money’s worth on the iPhone 15 is its camera. It features improvements across the board, from a higher-res main sensor to sharper zoomed-in shots.</p>



<p>The iPhone 15 swaps out the 12-megapixel primary lens that’s been on Apple’s default flagship since the 6S for a 48-megapixel camera. The ultra-wide, though, is identical to the iPhone 13: a 12-megapixel f/2.4 with a 120-degree field of view. The iPhone 15’s 12-megapixel selfie camera has a larger f/1.9 aperture and can capture more light in low-light conditions.</p>



<p>The iPhone 15 also gains a couple of handy software tricks: it automatically grabs the depth information in the default photo mode so that you don’t have to manually switch to Portrait, and can choose to turn the normal photo into a Portrait later in the Photos app. Plus, it leverages the main sensor’s ability to capture a larger volume of pixels to digitally replicate a physical telephoto lens and offer a much cleaner 2X zoom.</p>



<p>Under ample lighting, it’s hard to spot the iPhone 15’s camera boosts. Photos and videos taken on both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 13 are well-lit, plenty sharp, and feature a decent balance of highlights and shadows.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oOFphelDrKOU1zIiS1ZhPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/efc969fe675bf13876155cb34e6a6f8c" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>However, when I transferred some of those shots onto a larger screen, I did see the iPhone 15’s fifth-gen Smart HDR (as opposed to the 13’s fourth-gen) at play. It equally brings out your scene’s background and foreground. The iPhone 13, in comparison, tends to blow up the highlights and focuses more on emphasizing the subject. Plus, since the iPhone 15 is equipped with Apple’s Photonic Engine, it better retains the scene’s original texture, skin tones, and color, especially in the Portrait mode, where the subject’s details are even further accentuated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ABuZKp9Iw7K2cOcA__tEyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/b967b48383bcd6b3a5fe878ad879092c" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>The effects of the Photonic Engine &#8212; which takes numerous uncompressed images before your actual shot to gather more information about what you’re clicking &#8212; paired with the iPhone 15’s higher-res camera are most highlighted in low-light scenarios.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/G61p25rfgwzNuHjypsMDYA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/686b6e22d88628a48bc085cc1a862e7e" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>Whereas the iPhone 13 struggles to keep indoor nighttime shots (like at a bar) from turning out grainy and out of focus, the iPhone 15’s outcomes are richer in detail and far often less blurry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JHO2LzqBUaEN36zqdzU0og--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/laptopmag_536/5f22a27592fb685fa1a179ed13199f45" alt="iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 15: What does an extra $200 really get you?"/></figure>



<p>Because you can shoot pictures in a much higher resolution on the iPhone 15, you also have more room for edits later. On top of that, while the iPhone 15’s 2X zoom is still no match for a dedicated telephoto lens, it produces sharper images than the iPhone 13.</p>



<p>Videos taken on both phones are largely similar, but the iPhone 15 has two clear advantages: its 48MP camera produces fewer lens flares at night, and offers Action Mode, which keeps your videos steady even when you are moving.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: iPhone 15</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 13: verdict</h2>



<p>The iPhone 15 is objectively a more capable phone than the iPhone 13. However, apart from the camera, and perhaps the USB-C port, none of its upgrades are particularly significant.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to buy a new iPhone, I’d say the $200 difference is worth it. It will receive software updates at least two years longer than the iPhone 13 and the USB-C port will prove handy as Apple phases out Lightning. However, if you’re looking to upgrade from the iPhone 13, the iPhone 15 won’t be that big of a jump in experience. For that, I’d recommend waiting for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.laptopmag.com/news/huge-iphone-16-pro-rumors-suggest-you-should-skip-iphone-15-report" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 16</u></a>.</p>
